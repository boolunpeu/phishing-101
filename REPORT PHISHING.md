# CONCLUSION 

The results of the analysis show diversity in the origins, contents and intentions of the emails. 
However, the presence of features such as suspicious URLs, unknown email addresses, attempts to impersonate well-known brands and unusual requests strongly suggest a phishing intent behind these emails.
Almost every mail (excepted the one from service@paypal.be) are flagged as phishing email.

It's important to always remain vigilant and take appropriate security measures to protect yourself against such online scam attempts.
